OMG, just finished watching Opus, and I am absolutely wiped. Like seriously, my brain's still spinning. You know when a movie just sits in your mind, kinda gnawing at the edges? It’s like that but in a good way, lol. I mean, the way the characters were fleshed out, it had me thinking... are our lives even real or just scripts that someone else wrote?? Yeah, I know, sounds deep, right? 😂

But seriously, the whole time I was like, WHY are they doing that? And then—bam!—that crazy twist hits, and my jaw just dropped. For real, it’s movies like this that remind me why I bother to download the movie, you know? Thank god for that cuz I might need to see it again to catch what I missed the first time.

> Honestly, I need to stop overanalyzing everything, but I can't help it! Every little detail felt like it added another piece to the giant puzzle, and I’m just here trying to fit it all together. Ugh… I’m exhausted just thinking about it. 😂 But like, wasn’t that one scene with the red umbrella just the most symbolic thing ever? Or am I reading too much into it again? Whatever, it’s late.

Also, the soundtrack—whoever did the music deserves a freaking medal. It was so on point, like, carrying the whole mood of the film on its back. I might even download that soundtrack next. I swear, it really makes you notice how vital music is in movies, like when it just syncs perfectly with what’s happening on screen. Pure magic.

Anyway, if you haven’t watched the movie yet, do it! Need your perspective on it, too. Feeling a bit fried, so I’m gonna crash hard. Hit me up when you get the chance, we gotta dissect this more! 😂 Peace out.
